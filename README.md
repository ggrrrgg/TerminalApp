## GUIDE FOR USING THE APP:

### Overview
The mcontacts app is designed to function as a standard contact app would but with an additional search capability. The search function is configured to allow standard search by name but also gives you the ability to search by 'instrument or job (eg producer or sound engineer)' and location. If you are a producer or musical director and need a specific player for a show or session in a place thats unfamiliar you will be able to bring up a list of all the relevant people you know efficiently.

### Features
At initialization the app brings up a main menu feature which is self explanatory. 6 options allow you to create, edit, remove, update, and search your contact book. On selection, each function will guide through the process and then return you to the main menu. When finished, option 6 exits the application.

<i>note - In order for the search function to work as intended it is highly recommended to use consistent spelling for each instrument / location when adding or updating an entry. For example use 'Engineer' every time you are adding a new engineer contact, not 'Soundie' or 'Soundguy' etc (ver 2.0 will include a class system to address this issue, but in this instance of the application, the dev team were insufficiently briefed by management to implement this feature prior to release).</i>
